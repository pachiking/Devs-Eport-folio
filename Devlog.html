		this is day one of creating my E- portfolio, yeah its just a bunch of text on a screen now but soon it sure will be something. I am mostley using this for practise yes but, it still hope fuly be verry usefull later on.</p>

			but besides that,today i simply set up the files and "learnt" the basiscs of html. Ive still got a <strong>longggggg</strong> way before i can say ive actually done anything. but this is the start to my coding adventure.
			hopefully that long process will be nice.

			im trying to add some basic css to my website,whilw trying out Github to post it.Last time i tried Github it gave me a 404 error. So maybe i can figure out why it did that today.Later i have to study for a sceince exam so the coding sesion mqay be short lived. Tommorow I may not have a coding serssion depending on how well i feel.Ive got this splitting heaadache and school is sure not making it any better.
